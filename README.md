### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently I am an engineer working at a tech company.

I am interested in operating systems, distributed computing, deep learning, and programming/compiling techniques.

In my spare time, I also enjoy tinkering with my graphics toys and learning more about maths.

For more information, you can contact me at the following personal email addresses, I usually check my mail weekly,

- zytphor *at* outlook *dot* com

or you may prefer to create github issues directly.
